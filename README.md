React Shop is a portfolio pet project that I have developed. It is built using technologies such as React, Router, and advanced state management techniques like reducer, dispatch, useContext, useEffect, useSearchParams, useNavigate. The project also using a public API from https://dummyjson.com/.

React Shop is a nearly completed e-commerce application with fully functional features for shopping cart and product search. It showcases my skills in developing complex React applications, handling state management, and integrating with external APIs.
